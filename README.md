# iPhone Stock Checker

### Want to find out if your local apple store has stock for the iPhone you are after?

### Look no further! This node script will notify you as soon as there is stock for the iPhone you want!


#### How it Works?

- clone this repo
- npm i the dependencies
- run the `main.js` file in your terminal
- It will keep on running in the background every 2 minutes (customisable) and if there is stock for the phone you are after then it will notify you! :smile:
- **Currently set to search for iPhone 7 Plus in Matte Black 128GB in London Stores. Look into the customise section to tailor it to your need**


#### How to Customise?

- Replace storeName to your local stores
- Replace product with the iPhone you are after
- If you are based outside the uk, find the json links for your country and replace them, it will work!
